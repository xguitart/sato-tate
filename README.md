# sato-tate
Scripts used in the article "Fields of definition of elliptic k-curves and the realizability of all genus 2 Sato--Tate groups over a number field", by F. Fité and X. Guitart.

Description of the files:

40.sage --> Check of the entry for M = Q(\sqrt{-40}) or Table 3

40_bis.sage --> Check of the entry for M = Q(\sqrt{-40}) or Table 3, using the nicer model of E suggested by the referee and that appears in the revised version of the article

embedding_problem.m --> checking Lemma 3.23

list_of_Ks.sage --> check the Base change constructions of Section 4.2

table_of_ms.sage --> Computations for Table 3

twisted_group_algebra.m --> Computatons of Lemma 3.16

Table8.sage --> Check the fourth column of Table 8
